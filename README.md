This is a simple Python script I created to delete all of my Reddit comments. There is also an option to exclude specific subreddits from deletion as well, which I used to save comments from a few important subreddits.

If you want to use it, just fill in the empty strings with your own relevant values and run the script.

If you need help with it, feel free to send me a message.
